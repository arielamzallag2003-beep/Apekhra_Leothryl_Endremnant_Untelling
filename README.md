# The Untelling | Apekhra Leothryl Archive

> **"The Archive of the Endremnant. A fundamental cosmology documented through the fragments of the Silent Origin."**

## 🌌 Overview

The **Apekhra Leothryl Archive** is an interactive cosmological repository designed to host and visualize the fundamental laws of existence within the *Endremnant Untelling* setting. It transforms static Markdown lore into a dynamic, "unweaving" experience, structured across 12 ontological tiers.

## 🎡 Core Architecture

### 12-Tier Axiom Wheel
The archive follows the **Axiom-Wheel** structure, a 12-stage descent into the depth of the real:
- **Depth 0**: L'Alpha Insonore (The Silent Origin)
- **Depth 1**: L'Œil du Seer (The Curator's Eye)
- **...**
- **Depth 11**: Échos de l'Ombre (Anomalies & Erasure)

### Unweaving Text Engine
Lore content is rendered using the **Unweaving** effect:
- **Dynamic Dissolution**: Content appears to fray at the edges, reflecting the instability of the information.
- **Ontological Markers**: Headers and horizontal rules are spaced for clarity and thematic weight.
- **Status Widgets**: Real-time "Ontological Status" and "Local Resonance" indicators for every depth level.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Framework**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Lore Core**: [React-Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown)
- **Backend/Identity**: [@base44/sdk](https://www.base44.io/)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Development
Launch the interactive environment:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Maintenance Commands
Custom scripts for the Untelling environment:
- **`npm run restart`**: Terminate hanging instances and force-start the dev server.
- **`npm run release`**: Build and preview the production-ready archive.
- **`npm run release:restart`**: Clean build and immediate production preview.

## 🖋️ Documenting the Lore

All lore is stored in the root folder structure, organized by Tiers.
1. Create a `.md` file in the corresponding Tier folder (e.g., `01_Tier_0_Palace_of_Fantasy/`).
2. The `loreService` will automatically detect and list the file in the Axiom Wheel.
3. Ensure all files are encoded in **UTF-8** to preserve the arcane symbols and accents.
